# The Weather Wherever

## Description
A simple web app that allows you to enter a city and pull up a current 5-day weather forecast for that area.
Uses a few OpenWeatherMap APIs to convert a search query to coordinates, and then to grab current weather conditions and a five-day forecast.

Simply type any city name into the search bar, and watch the weather information show up!
